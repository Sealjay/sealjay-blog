            "content_html": "<p>I&#x27;ve been watching the development of AI in the creative sector, and I thought it was time to talk about it. The creative sector seems to be embracing the use of AI to supplement creativity and content creation, rather than replacing any one task. Right now, AI in its broadest sense is referring to (in AI parlance) the second wave of &#x27;statistical learning&#x27; - solving problem domains, but not yet having the power to generate new ideas and understanding based on context, or the third wave of AI. This is then driving how the creative sector is able to use AI.</p>\n<h3 id=\"creationsparking-new-ideas\">Creation - Sparking new ideas</h3>\n<p>Retail and marketing organisations are using AI to spark new ideas - for example, during workshops, transcribing the conversation, and searching for related concepts, which could allow people to make new connections. This is also improving rote tasks of content management - automatically captioning images which a human has selected to accompany a news article, or <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/bing-image-search-api/?WT.mc_id=AI-MVP-5004204\">searching for new images that could be used</a> using tools like Bing Image Search; with the ability to filter by newness, and how &#x27;formal&#x27; the image is.</p>\n<h3 id=\"increasing-touchpoints\">Increasing touchpoints</h3>\n<p>AI is allowing creative organisations to improve the touchpoints with their customers. For example, Avanade is working with a multinational entertainment company to create virtual agents - characters that can respond on-brand, in an engaging way. This is a new avenue, allowing two-way conversations, for new characters that respond to customers using the same phrasing, and evoking the same persona; and allowing customers to chat with their favourite brands in and around the media they watch.</p>\n<h3 id=\"improving-sustaining-the-brand\">Improving &amp; sustaining the brand</h3>\n<p>The use of these new touchpoints also allows creative organisations new opportunities to improve their brand. For example, <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/how-to-custom-voice-create-voice?WT.mc_id=AI-MVP-5004204\">I&#x27;ve worked in the past with Microsoft speech technology to create recognisable, on-brand “voice fonts”</a> – allowing for virtual agents to synthesise voice in a way that matches voice actors. These AI technologies are also allowing creative organisations to leverage the results of previous campaigns and promotional messages to recommend new messages, and predict the success of the next campaign.</p>\n<h3 id=\"generationcreating-initial-designs\">Generation - Creating initial designs</h3>\n<p>Probably one of the most impactful use of AI right now is in generation - using AI to look at historic content, and generate designs combined in new and differing ways. This is really lowering the barrier for creatives to support startups and burgeoning companies - <a href=\"https://www.wix.com/\">for example, Wix</a> is using AI to generate websites that match a certain colour scheme, and information architecture; <a href=\"https://logojoy.com/\">and Logojoy</a> is using AI to generate custom logos, typography, and colour schemes. Key to this though, and going back to the idea of &#x27;statistical learning&#x27; in AI - for the premium experience, and that level of creativity, a human creative still needs to augment the AI created designs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-are-the-challenges-to-the-use-of-ai-in-the-creative-industries\">What are the challenges to the use of AI in the creative industries?</h2>\n<p>The main challenge with AI right now is where it sits as a tool. The creative industry doesn&#x27;t seem to be adopting AI techniques to solve the problems they are best at, but rather seeing it as an &#x27;either-or.&#x27; For example, <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/shows/ai-show/sketch2code?WT.mc_id=AI-MVP-5004204\">tools like Sketch2code from Microsoft</a> can take wireframes and designs, to create a working prototype which designers and developers can collaborate on, and test.</p>\n<p>This should be a net positive - these technologies don&#x27;t understand the vagaries of accessibility, they can&#x27;t support with a content strategy, and they aren&#x27;t able to add animation or logic - <a href=\"https://www.econotimes.com/if-ai-is-already-writing-code-will-programmers-lose-their-jobs-1426913\">but most of the response to this seems to have a fear that developers will lose their jobs</a>. Developers wrote this, and ultimately need to accept where AI can add value and do things better so that the creative industry can focus on that spark of generating new ideas.</p>\n<p>It’s clear that AI is not currently sophisticated enough to fully replace creatives in the industry, but is there a sense that these technologies could hamper creativity?Certainly with the current wave of AI and design, there&#x27;s certainly a sense that these technologies could hamper creativity. Most of the technologies currently available are simply using historic data to replicate styles we already have, or recombining those styles in new ways.</p>\n<p>There may be a phrase &#x27;there is nothing new under the sun&#x27; but certainly if we are to prove that wrong, AI as it is won&#x27;t help.In 2016, <a href=\"https://www.thereforefilms.com/sunspring.html\">an AI neural network called &#x27;Benjamin&#x27; wrote a screenplay</a>, including stage directions and dialog- this script then needed interpretation by a human, to be converted into a masterpiece.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.udemy.com/artificial-intelligence-music-creation-remixing-2018/\">In 2018, online courses were trumpeting the ability of people to become music stars, using AI tools to compose and remix music</a>; <a href=\"https://aiva.ai/creations\">similar to a startup, AIVA</a>, which composes emotional soundtracks that have already been used in the background to real videos. AI could hamper creativity if analytics are used to predict the future success of something new, based on what has gone before - modelling this type of impact could lead to companies becoming more risk-averse, rather than continuing to provoke new thought and discussion.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-will-ai-evolve-within-the-creative-industries\">How will AI evolve within the creative industries?</h2>\n<p>Ultimately I think AI in the creative industries will evolve in the same way as elsewhere - having the ability to self-generate &#x27;new&#x27; content, and different ideas, rather than recombining the past. I think the key is how well the creative industries embrace this.AI won&#x27;t start by creating the greatest screenplay, or the best art, and will still require humans to add that artistic flare for some time - but it might enable humans to realise creativity and art that we didn&#x27;t have the ability to produce before. <a href=\"https://odico.dk/\">For example, Odico is a Danish startup which is using AI and robotics to produce unique architecture and realise complex shapes</a> that are out of reach of traditional construction techniques.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>The <a href=\"https://greensoftware.foundation/articles/call-to-action-on-green-software-establishing-a-centre-of-excellence\">Call to Action (CTA) series at the Green Software Foundation continues</a>, a recurring series on practical actions around Green Software.</p>\n<blockquote>Green software is yet to reach the tipping point—that magic moment when an idea, trend, or social behaviour crosses a threshold, tips, and spreads like wildfire. Part of our role should be to make our own evangelism unnecessary and green software the default.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>In my first article, I talked about <a href=\"https://greensoftware.foundation/articles/call-to-action-spreading-the-message-of-green-software\"><u>spreading the message of green software</u></a> within organisations. I addressed grassroots change and the importance of organisational support for change. In the second article, I talked about <a href=\"https://greensoftware.foundation/articles/cta-success-factors-measurements-and-driving-the-right-behaviour\"><u>success factors, measurements and metrics</u></a> to ensure your organisation is fully supportive of greening software.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>After having identified the business benefits of adopting green software—as well as the broader societal reasons for this adoption!—and gained early buy-in for this change, you&#x27;ll eventually hit your next challenge: who drives this change?</blockquote>\n<blockquote><strong>Green Software Engineering should be self-sustaining</strong></blockquote>\n<blockquote>In 2002, in <em>The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference</em>, Malcolm Gladwell explored the science behind human behaviour and the adoption of practices. He defined a tipping point as &quot;that magic moment when an idea, trend, or social behaviour crosses a threshold, tips, and spreads like wildfire.&quot;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>I believe that Green Software Engineering has the capacity to be self-sustaining, in the same way that organisations have previously adopted various methodologies and practices as a new default, from Agile and Test-Driven Development to the use of Microservices and Open-Source Software. Admittedly, organisations are at various points on this change journey. However, we aren&#x27;t yet at this tipping point for Green Software Engineering.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Part of our role should be to make our own evangelism unnecessary. We should build the structures, conduct training, and adopt ways of thinking to make green software the default.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>I mentioned that grassroots adoption and evangelism can influence the behaviour of your peers. Gladwell goes further, talking about the need to create a community around people to drive a fundamental change in people&#x27;s beliefs and behaviour.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>In that mindset, making green software ubiquitous, today I’ll focus on the capabilities an organisation should build. These new capabilities are people enablers, to <em>create </em>green software, and support the practice of new skills.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>I’ll close by setting the scene for future articles on the actual nuts and bolts—the fundamental activities—that teams can adopt; for example, reporting and instrumentation, to write, improve, and use green software.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><strong>A brief recap...</strong></blockquote>\n<blockquote>We know the importance of a green mindset, and strong sponsorship and champions within your organisation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>We also understand why organisations might want to green their software, and how each organisation can identify and measure their unique benefit, within the technology or governance of your organisation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>The final leg of this stool is the doing function, the mechanism by which we train people, improve processes, and change the way we work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><strong>What do I mean by a “doing function”?</strong></blockquote>\n<blockquote>Being deliberately vague here, a doing function is any team or group of people which is capable of helping your organisation to build capability, adopt new practices, and shift the status quo.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>If we use the adoption of Open Source, or Inner Source as a model here, your Green Software function might already be well established. Larger enterprises may have several teams looking at various different aspects of Green Software.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Here are some approaches that might be suitable for your organisation to adopt as a doing function, as there is no one size that fits all. What works for an open-source project or small to medium business isn&#x27;t necessarily a good fit for a larger enterprise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>And your organisation may want to adopt multiple approaches to reach your end goal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><strong>Approaches you could adopt</strong></blockquote>\n<blockquote><strong><strong>Centre of Excellence </strong></strong>- A Centre of Excellence (COE) is often the most formal organisational construct for sharing knowledge. This is usually a group of people or a team that can coordinate training, process improvement, and knowledge sharing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><strong><strong>Community of Practice</strong></strong> - The term Community of Practice refers to people that share a passion or interest. It provides a forum to share information and for peers to learn from one another. These communities of practice often form organically, but can be harder to sustain, as people can rotate in and out of the community based on need, and the amount of time they have available.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><strong><strong>Project Team or Committee</strong></strong> - A project team is a good way to start sharing Green Software practices. For example, you can set up a project team or committee for creating a training plan for your organisation. This approach could also be suitable if your Green Software initiative is to be delivered by a corporate function, such as human resources, or learning and development. However, unless your organisation has such a deep interest in green software that the practices become self-sustaining, this is unlikely to lead to lasting change. This is because project teams are usually a temporary construct, and by their nature have an expiration date.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><strong><strong>Network of Representatives</strong></strong> - In a highly federated engineering or manufacturing organisation, you might have a network of representatives or champions that come together to share best practices. These are similar to a community of practice, but are formally embedded within each product team to champion the adoption of the new change.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Your organisation may use different terms for some of these approaches, which perform a similar activity, but the overall ideas should be applicable anywhere.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>For the rest of this article, I&#x27;m going to focus on a Centre of Excellence, the activities you could start with, and how you can sustain this, but the advice should be broadly applicable to every approach.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><strong>Centres of Excellence: Getting started</strong></blockquote>\n<blockquote>By this point, I&#x27;m assuming you have an understanding of who your business sponsor is for this initiative, and the success factors you&#x27;re driving towards. If not, you might want to refer back to articles one and two, <a href=\"https://greensoftware.foundation/articles/call-to-action-spreading-the-message-of-green-software\"><u>spreading the message of Green Software</u></a>,<a href=\"https://greensoftware.foundation/articles/cta-success-factors-measurements-and-driving-the-right-behaviour\"> <u>and measuring success</u></a>, respectively.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><strong>First steps</strong></blockquote>\n<blockquote>So, you&#x27;ve established a Centre of Excellence, or COE. Well done! Your journey is just beginning. As you spread the message, you may have identified supporters and those with a keen interest in green software.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Your COE will need to begin by creating a clear purpose for being, identifying the roles you require, how you will share knowledge, and why joining or working with your community is valuable for your peers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><strong>Framing the purpose</strong></blockquote>\n<blockquote>The core group that establishes the COE will be the centre of your community and are responsible for building trust with the rest of the organisation, as well as setting a positive culture. You&#x27;ll want to spend time as a group ensuring that you all have the same common goals and purpose, as this will influence the activities you undertake.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><strong>Identifying roles - and your community of practitioners</strong></blockquote>\n<blockquote>As you set up your COE, you&#x27;ll be negotiating formal roles that might be set by your organisation, and the ad-hoc roles that you fall into through practice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>The role of your COE may initially aim to create a community of practitioners that care, deliberately seeding some elements that a Community of Practice would otherwise take on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>You may want to invite the supporters you have identified to join the COE, either formally if you are able to do so, or as part of a broader community. As the core of your community, you might want to adopt them formally into leadership roles or ask them to present and share their experience. By adopting supporters formally into your community, you can increase motivation, and keep engagement high.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>COE members appointed to leadership positions could represent the interests of their community; for example, a technical community, such as frontend developers, or a geographical community, such as those located in a specific office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><strong>Sharing knowledge and maintaining engagement</strong></blockquote>\n<blockquote>Your COE will need to identify how knowledge will be shared. First, synchronous sharing. Will you have a regular community call, or an in-person meeting? Is your organisation entirely remote, hybrid, or are you separated across different geographical locations?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Most organisations will also have formal channels for sharing tacit knowledge in an asynchronous fashion. Think manuals, standard operating procedures, code, newsletters, and instruction guides. Keep things simple and frictionless as you can, remembering you&#x27;re another place for people to spend their precious attention. Sending out polls in Slack, Teams, Yammer, Workplace, and other social networks can be a lightweight way to maintain engagement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><strong>Making adoption irresistible and irreversible</strong></blockquote>\n<blockquote>Early activities of your COE should focus on what community members can gain by adopting Green Software principles, and by changing the context of Green Software. Ask how you can remove barriers to make it frictionless to create and learn about carbon-efficient software.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><strong>What&#x27;s in it for me?</strong></blockquote>\n<blockquote>We need to put ourselves in our colleagues&#x27; shoes. We&#x27;re probably yet another demand on their time. So we need to show the personal benefits that learning about green software can bring to each person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>For example, supporting your COE could support an individual&#x27;s career development, as they pick up and learn new skills. It could also be a chance for them to make a significant change for their team, such as improving a DevOps pipeline to make it more efficient or maintainable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>I recommend creating personas to represent the types of people within your organisation that you are looking to support. For example, consider a full-stack developer persona or a salesperson persona. You can then identify different needs, goals and motivations they might have and select or prioritise activities accordingly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><strong>Making it frictionless</strong></blockquote>\n<blockquote>Just as I&#x27;ve been writing about how you can get started with Green Software, your peers will need pointers and support to get started.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>One approach you can use is recipe cards or small activities that you can promote within your organisation. These could be posted on an intranet or emailed out regularly to interested people across your organisation. Each activity should have a time attached to it, from small activities that could take 5 minutes, such as reading an article, to hands-on activities that may take multiple hours, such as e-learning modules, or self-study software labs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><strong>Centres of Excellence: Continuing into the future</strong></blockquote>\n<blockquote>This is the start of your journey by pulling together a like minded team. Whether that&#x27;s informally as a Community of Practice, a formal Centre of Excellence, or some other vehicle which works for your organisation, you now have a direction and the start of a plan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>In future articles, I&#x27;ll be focussing on more detailed activities and approaches that your teams can adopt, including observability, instrumentation, devops practices as well as incentives for change and the use of nudge theory. The team you pull together will be key to adopting these techniques.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>As your community comes together, please remember that we, at the Green Software Foundation, need your help. Your community will be well placed to support our open-source projects including:</blockquote>\n<blockquote><a href=\"https://greensoftware.foundation/projects/principles-of-green-software-engineering\"><u>The Principles of Green Software Engineering</u></a> - Training on reducing the carbon emissions of a software system. Your community can contribute their thoughts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><a href=\"https://greensoftware.foundation/projects/awesome-green-software\"><u>Awesome Green Software</u></a> - As your community contributes tools and ideas, promote them here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><a href=\"https://greensoftware.foundation/projects/writers\"><u>Green Software Writers</u></a> - As I&#x27;ve done, ask your community members to write about their experience with green software.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>And finally,<a href=\"https://greensoftware.foundation/projects/speakers\"> <u>you could reach out to our Green Software Speakers community</u></a>, to speak at an event your community runs. Or you may want to speak about green software yourself. Either way, you can find a lot of resources and support from us.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Feel free to reach out on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gsfcommunity\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/green-software-foundation\">LinkedIn</a> and other forums and share with me other topics you&#x27;d like me to cover regarding practical actions you can take to spread the message of green software.</blockquote>\n<p>This article is licenced under <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Creative Commons (CC BY 4.0)</a></p>",

            "content_html": "<p>Over the last year, it won&#x27;t have escaped anyone&#x27;s notice really that there have been massive and unprecedented changes to the health of the world, and by extension, how healthcare is delivered.a</p>\n<p>Microsoft&#x27;s  <a href=\"https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/quantum/2022/01/27/nasas-jpl-uses-microsofts-azure-quantum-to-manage-communication-with-space-missions/?WT.mc_id=AI-MVP-5004204\">new blog on using Azure Quantum to manage communication with space missions</a>   had me thinking, about the Future of Edge, Space Networking, and the Internet of Things.</p>\n<h2>First, let me set the scene with IoT...</h2>\n<p>The Internet of Things - commonly known as IoT – describes the interconnection of everyday objects and spaces, using new and existing devices, leveraging improved connectivity and platforms, to enable brand new experiences. These experiences can be enterprise-focused to support optimized operations, such as predictive maintenance, or quality control – as well as consumer and employee focussed, e.g. tracking worker fatigue, or personalizing products for customers.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Internet of Things - commonly known as IoT – describes the interconnection of everyday objects and spaces.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>What&#x27;s driving this increase in IoT?</h2>\n<p>IoT is being driven by the massive opportunity to unlock new opportunities, which weren’t previously possible, and to make better use of the data that existing devices were generating.</p>\n<p>The intersection of data platforms and the changing nature of network infrastructure has converged with the availability of cheap and easily deployable hardware modules.</p>\n<h3>Connectivity</h3>\n<p>These connectivity changes range from wide-area network standards such as LoRa, increasing speeds available with WiFi 5 onwards (as well as urban city-wide adoption schemes), and the rise of 5G cellular phone availability.</p>\n<h3>Intelligence</h3>\n<p>In addition to connectivity and data platforms, it’s easier than ever to deploy intelligence, from specialized algorithms to tiny machine learning models, to low power devices. This is both supporting the ability to process  <em>out of the cloud</em> and where events are happening, but it’s also enabling networking infrastructure to be better managed, for example, through software-defined networking; a truly virtuous circle.</p>\n<h2>How does IoT relate to Edge?</h2>\n<p>Edge means a lot of different things to a lot of different people. The truth is, the internet as-is wasn’t designed for the current demands placed upon it; it grew from a high-trust environment from military and academic collaboration to supporting global hyperconnectivity between parties that know nothing about each other.</p>\n<p>Our hyperconnected planet is a patchwork of internet coverage, of varying latency and bandwidths; full of “dead zones” and network dead-ends. To that end, the Edge is no longer computing outside of the cloud or a datacenter – instead, the Edge is anywhere the internet isn’t.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Edge is anywhere the internet isn’t.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>How is networking changing the game?</h3>\n<p>Networking is increasing bandwidth, and expanding up to space, and down under the sea – but whilst bandwidth might increase, latency is a fundamental constraint, due to processing limitations, and the limitation of the speed of light as a transmission speed.</p>\n<h1>The rise of new architectural patterns</h1>\n<p>Software Engineers are building hyper-scale applications to serve the world – or at least many different locations; but the software engineering patterns and practices of the last five years coalesced in a period of co-located containers, burgeoning content delivery networks, and replicated databases [ <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/guide/design-principles/use-the-best-data-store?WT.mc_id=AI-MVP-5004204#recommendations\">bounded by the CAP theorem of consistency, availability, and partition tolerance</a> .]</p>\n<p>Our enterprise systems were often built upon synchronous assumptions, where availability was a given, common attitudes towards data usage and privacy were expected, and data transfers were outside the realm of nation-states.</p>\n<p>To put it simply, those assumptions no longer hold true. From now, and for the next couple of years, we’re seeing devices proliferate to avoid the constraint of latency and networking speeds. We’re seeing companies figure out how they can update and recycle these. Bandwidth might increase, but latency will remain the hard limitation.</p>\n<h2>Resolutions</h2>\n<p>Engineers will begin designing for the “demassified era” – understanding how to handle processes with components that may be located across short or infinitesimal distances. Partition tolerance will become a guiding principle. Companies will be designing for the edge by default, and focus on how they make better sense of the data. For the purposes of Cognitive Search, or Machine Learning, this could likely involve bringing algorithms to the data, and returning indexed results. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>demassified (past tense) divide or break up (a social or political unit) into its component parts.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Optimizing bandwidth usage</h3>\n<p>If the Edge is where the internet isn’t, the focus will be on optimizing bandwidth usage to avoid overage charges and the cost of shifting data from point to point. We’re shifting from this idea that data transmission is free, to pay for the fuel which shifts our data currency.</p>\n<h3>Instant Gratification</h3>\n<p>Systems will move away from &quot;instant gratification&quot; to reconciliation and retransmission – this means that they won’t expect a synchronous response, and that software will need to consider whether processes are “immediate”, “resolving”, or “long-running.”</p>\n<p>Short bursts of data will happen on the edge, and data will be processed and used when needed, and when cheapest. Like charging an electric vehicle on your mains electricity, your autonomous systems, such as in-car devices, will drive and “report” when it returns to a “home” wifi station.</p>\n<h3>Radical overhaul of the internet transport layer</h3>\n<p>If we consider the fact that computing through the Cloud is what enables overage charges to become an everyday reality, then the internet transport layer itself will be radically overhauled for the future of networking systems. From Cloudflare here on Earth, computing at the Edge of the well-connected network, to OneWeb, and Starlink, we’re seeing the rise of new paradigms that our messaging systems need to contend with. A few years ago, who would have considered that commercial space telecommunication and standards could be in our near future?</p>\n<h3>Second-order effects</h3>\n<p>As the network solidifies up to space, and down under the sea, the rise of standards could see prices dropping. This isn’t the first time that mass infrastructure has required global adoption. Telegrams followed the model established by the International Telecommunication Union in 1865 – hard problems generate collaboration.</p>\n<h1>From Space to Global Applications – further out on the Horizon</h1>\n<h2>The Growth of Space Infrastructure</h2>\n<p>In the long term, even Space needs standards. When space travel was limited to the capabilities of nation-states, one or two spaceships noisily hogging the analogue spectrum was fine. With interference in space, we’ll need to consider how communications take place over longer distances, from lensing of laser signals, physical throwing of data storage, to how we slice and use the available spectrum. It’s our current grappling with radio networking writ large.</p>\n<h3>Shared Infrastructure?</h3>\n<p>Will we see an establishment of solar-system wide backhaul of cooperative satellites to store, buffer, and forward messages? Will space ships have electromagnetically hardened and standardized black boxes, capable of locating, and contacting the backhaul? Be that Starlink, OneWeb, or another consortium yet to be built.</p>\n<h2>The Sneakernet is still a competitor</h2>\n<p>Andrew Tanenbaum said in 1981, &quot;Never underestimate the bandwidth of a station wagon full of tapes hurtling down the highway.&quot; The SneakerNet phenomenon - aka, putting on your sneakers and physically carrying your data – never really left us.  <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databox/data-box-heavy-overview?WT.mc_id=AI-MVP-5004204\">Microsoft has Azure Data Box Heavy </a> – a 500lb disk to transfer a petabyte of data into Azure, and AWS has their Amazon SnowBall.</p>\n<p>And  <a href=\"https://what-if.xkcd.com/31/\">as XKCD naturally took to its logical conclusion</a> , the Internet wouldn’t surpass the “bandwidth” of FedEx until 2040 – and that’s using today&#x27;s storage tools.</p>\n<p>As we expand geographically, physically transferring data and then completing data reconciliation may remain an attractive option; particularly with those data ingress/egress fees…</p>\n<h2>Just let it crumble</h2>\n<p>One common problem with managing physical infrastructure is the requirement to update, secure, and track your IoT assets. Who is responsible when hardware needs to be upgraded?</p>\n<p>One solution on the horizon could be taking a biological approach. Microchips may not always be silicon-based – nano-cellulose or other biodegradable alternatives are one way to avoid the burden of updates and replacement. Imagine growing your microchips with embedded software to avoid leaving an attack surface for your software to be attacked; and then simply letting them biodegrade.</p>\n<h1>Some ponderings and possible futures...</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>To avoid the constraint of latency and networking speeds, devices are proliferating, to compute closer to where the activities are happening.</li>\n<li>Engineers will begin designing for the “demassified era” – understanding how to deal with processes with components that may be located across short or infinitesimal distances.</li>\n<li>Systems will move away from &quot;instant gratification&quot; to reconciliation and retransmission – this means that they won’t expect a synchronous response, and that software will need to consider whether processes are “immediate”, “resolving”, or “long-running.”</li>\n<li>Microchips may not always be silicon-based – nano-cellulose or other biodegradable alternatives are one way to avoid the burden of updates and replacement.</li>\n<li>A solar-system wide backhaul of cooperative satellites will be established to store, buffer, and forward messages.</li>\n<li>Space ships will have hardened standardized black boxes, capable of contacting the backhaul – be that Starlink, OneWeb, or another consortium yet to be built.</li>\n<li>Edge is only where the internet isn’t – and the internet could be everywhere, with the right commercial impetus</li>\n<li>The internet transport layer is being radically overhauled - Edge will include space, and laser links could proliferate</li>\n<li>Commercial space telecommunication will follow the model established by the International Telecommunication Union in 1865 – and nation-states will only regulate space.</li>\n</ul>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/quantum/2022/01/27/nasas-jpl-uses-microsofts-azure-quantum-to-manage-communication-with-space-missions/\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\"><p>NASA’s JPL uses Microsoft’s Azure Quantum to manage communication with\nspace missions - Microsoft Azure Quantum Blog</p></div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\"><p>As NASA launches more frequent and complex missions into space, managing\ncommunications with the growing number of spacecraft is becoming\nincreasingly challenging.

Copilot is a new software tool in the Intelligent Code Creation (ICC) category, using powerful machine learning models from  <a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/\">OpenAI</a> , including GPT-3 and Codex, to develop significantly faster and more efficiently.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>GitHub Copilot is supported for use on Visual Studio Code, JetBrains variants (including Rider and IntelliJ), and Neovim.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Automatic suggestions</strong>\nCopilot can autosuggest solutions for the context you’re working in, but it can also understand natural human language in comments and function names, to synthesize a solution for your current task.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Copilot is trained from software documents, and public code repositories, whilst also utilising your own code to improve its suggestions, in line with your coding style; supplying highly relevant suggestions based on what you are currently working on.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Code generation from natural language</strong>\nThanks to OpenAI Codex, GitHub Copilot has the incredible ability to turn natural language into code. Write the logic you wish to achieve in a comment, and Copilot will try and create that functionality with code.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This can lead to one or more suggestions, including those spanning multiple lines of logic, making Copilot an excellent tool for existing developers to improve their productivity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Learning to code</strong>\nDevelopers that are learning to code will find that Copilot is a useful learning tool, giving developers the ability to play with code, using natural language to synthesize well written and formatted code suggestions, rather than heavy reliance on copy/paste, documentation, code samples, and tutorials.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This should make it faster to implement working solutions quickly, instead of spending time unravelling the sample code to find out what has gone wrong from the version in your clipboard; although the human ability to discern and understand will remain important.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Removing the bugbear of boilerplate... but what’s the cost?</strong>\nCopilot can generate repetitive language in code, like quickly generating lists of sample data for testing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Beyond the benefits of a system trained on large public code repositories, there are issues to be aware of. When code suggestions are based on popularity, or usage, you can’t guarantee that the code suggestions are using the most up to date implementations, libraries, and approaches.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If a new security flaw is found, Copilot may generate code without the correct fixes applied; and with such a vast training set, there is no sole source of truth or ‘correctness’ and other people’s bad coding habits may blindly end up in your code base. In one example we tested, we were even given someone else’s API key in a hard coded REST request. Oops!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One current pitfall is where new libraries or frameworks with significant breaking changes are released. Since the systems are trained on existing code repositories, it will take a significant amount of time for the available code to reflect the new versions. This may lead developers who aren’t in the know to continue developing for outdated versions instead of using the latest and greatest available to them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>GitHub Copilot is an incredible update to the AI pair programming world - and it looks set to continue into the future,  <a href=\"https://github.com/github/feedback/discussions/8308\">with another feature on the horizon including code explanation</a>   of highlighted code blocks. </p>\n<p>There&#x27;s been some controversy on the internet around the use of public code - but with the rise of Tabnine, Kite, and others - the trend looks set to continue for now.</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card kg-card-hascaption\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://copilot.github.com\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\"><p>GitHub Copilot · Your AI pair programmer</p></div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\"><p>GitHub Copilot works alongside you directly in your editor, suggesting\nwhole lines or entire functions for you.</p></div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-metadata\"><img class=\"kg-bookmark-icon\" src=\"https://github.com/fluidicon.png\" alt=\"\"/><span class=\"kg-bookmark-author\">GitHub Copilot</span></div></div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-thumbnail\"><img src=\"http://copilot.github.com/social.png\" alt=\"\"/></div></a><figcaption>Join the preview program!</figcaption></figure>\n<p></p>",

(2021). Software Carbon Intensity Standard\n(Version 1.0.0)\n</em>)</p></p>\n<p>These actions can come in many forms.</p>\n<h3 id=\"energy-efficiency\">Energy Efficiency</h3>\n<p><p>For cloud aficionados, energy efficiency can be approached both by improving\nthe efficiency of the underlying software (or using </p><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/applications/machine-learning/preprocess-data/transfer-learning-tensorflow?WT.mc_id=AI-MVP-5004204\"><p>techniques like transfer learning when training a machine learning model</p></a><p>), but also by rightsizing the cloud infrastructure being used. For example, Sara\nBergman <a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/sustainable-software/how-can-i-calculate-co2eq-emissions-for-my-azure-vm/?WT.mc_id=AI-MVP-5004204\">\nhas written an excellent article\n</a> on calculating the CO<sub>2</sub>eq of a virtual machine; using a similar\nformula, we can roughly estimate the CO<sub>2</sub>eq of a container, <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/?WT.mc_id=AI-MVP-5004204\">\nor an Azure Function\n</a>.</p></p>\n<p><p>Whilst the target figures are likely some way off from the reality (presumably\nonly your cloud provider knows the true figures), we can be confident enough\nto say that Containers and Serverless Computing are likely significantly more\nenergy &amp; carbon-efficient than running an application in a whole virtual\nmachine.</p></p>\n<h3 id=\"hardware-efficiency\">Hardware Efficiency</h3>\n<p><p>Hardware efficiency in turn could mean moving to a cloud, with economies of\nscale, and the ability of a cloud provider to be carbon neutral. </p><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/compliance/assurance/assurance-datacenter-environmental-safeguards#energy-efficiency?WT.mc_id=AI-MVP-5004204\"><p>Microsoft commits to be carbon negative by 2030 for example</p></a><p>, and to remove all historic carbon since it was founded in 1975, by 2050.</p></p>\n<p><p>However, hardware efficiency could also include extending the life of your\nexisting hardware. For example, </p><a href=\"https://www.opencompute.org/blog/open-compute-open-sustainability-open-possibilities\"><p>the Open Compute Project (OCP) has been looking at how to apply circular\neconomic principles to your IT infrastructure</p></a><p>.</p></p>\n<h3 id=\"carbon-awareness\">Carbon Awareness</h3>\n<p><p>The final action that the specification describes, is Carbon Awareness. That\nis, knowing the current fuel mix of your energy grid, and running applications\nwhen the energy has been created through renewables, as opposed to fossil\nfuels.</p></p>\n<p><p>Some datacentres have private energy supplies; but others are connected to the\npublic and national grid, in whatever country they happen to be located.</p></p>\n<p><p>For the UK, you can see the UK&#x27;s energy fuel mix in real time at <a href=\"https://electricityinfo.org/real-time-british-electricity-supply/\">the\nelectricity\ninfo</a> \nwebsite. At the time of writing, 22.7% of the UK&#x27;s energy in the grid right\nnow, is from renewable sources. In the last 24 hours, 43% of the energy came\nfrom renewable sources.</p></p>\n<p><p>If you can embed this awareness into your software, you can enable your\nsoftware to lower its own emissions. </p></p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/software_carbon_intensity/blob/main/Software_Carbon_Intensity/Software_Carbon_Intensity_Specification.md#software-sustainability-actions\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\"><p>software_carbon_intensity/Software_Carbon_Intensity_Specification.md at\nmain · Green-Software-Foundation/software_carbon_intensity</p></div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\"><p>A specification that describes how to calculate a carbon intensity for\nsoftware applications. -\nsoftware_carbon_intensity/Software_Carbon_Intensity_Specification.md at\nmain · Green-Software-Foundat...</p></div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-metadata\"><img class=\"kg-bookmark-icon\" src=\"https://github.com/fluidicon.png\" alt=\"\"/><span class=\"kg-bookmark-author\">GitHub</span><span class=\"kg-bookmark-publisher\">Green-Software-Foundation</span></div></div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-thumbnail\"><img src=\"https://opengraph.githubassets.com/af07ed5a4ee78ebe5b5369c72d5111bf37bea6ae0ad8bf1ddab2991fb142ca1b/Green-Software-Foundation/software_carbon_intensity\" alt=\"\"/></div></a></figure>\n<h3 id=\"the-future\">The future</h3>\n<p><p>It&#x27;s exciting.

Each action is described in a YAML defined workflow file that let you execute logic based upon events like Pull Requests, Pushes to branches, issue creation etc.</p>\n<p>Many projects need specific workflows and requirements, such as a restriction on the approved open-source licences, a desire to create issues based on &#x27;#TODO:&#x27; notes buried in code comments, or to make life easier.</p>\n<h3>How do you set up a GitHub action?</h3>\n<p>GitHub Actions YAML files are stored within a code repository, in a dot folder called <code>.github/workflows/</code>. You can define one or more  <em>workflows</em> which developers can use to group together different related jobs and actions.</p>\n<p>Each <em>workflow</em> defines a series of <em>jobs</em>. A <em>job</em> is made up of multiple <em>steps</em>. A <em>step</em> combines multiple  <em>actions</em>. Finally, all of this runs on a <em>runner</em> somewhere - a machine or a container spun up to run and execute your workflow.</p>\n<p>Finally, you define which <em>event</em> triggers which <em>workflows</em>. Got that?! This diagram might show better how everything fits together.</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/09/GHA-Blog.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"A diagram showing an event triggering a workflow.

Backed by blockchain technology, multiple parties can add data entries in a secure and tamperproof way to ensure data integrity whilst allowing flexibility in the data and approach.</p>\n<p>Azure&#x27;s confidential computing technology and hardware can secure data during processing, to ensure confidentiality of data end-to-end rather than just when at rest or in transit. This allows for processing of sensitive and regulated data in the cloud, to enable specific use cases such as cross-organizational data sharing, data combination, and processing of large datasets to train AI models without exposing the data to others.</p>\n<p>Azure Confidential Ledger runs on similar principles to those used in <a href=\"https://www.avanade.com/en/blogs/techs-and-specs/azure/blockchain-sql-server-ledger-tables\">Azure SQL ledger tables, which we explored previously</a> for Microsoft Build 2021. Azure Confidential Ledger gives us the same level of trust and integrity, without the need for a managed SQL database or dedicated SQL server. Entries can be quickly added to the ledger as and when they occur, with receipts for each transaction to validate each entry. Entries can also be read from the ledger, so a full history can be established, without the ability of any party to tamper with the historical content.</p>\n<p>Entries can vary, from the short and simple, to verbose or unstructured data formats. This provides great flexibility in what can be logged to the ledger, making Azure Confidential Ledger suitable for many use cases. Data formats can be changed or adapted over time, and entries don’t have to conform to a single standard from the point of creation, so confidential ledger can evolve with the problem space it has been implemented in, while retaining the history of data.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Using Azure Confidential Ledger is <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/msdn-magazine/2019/april/azure-confidential-computing-secure-multi-party-machine-learning-with-azure-confidential-computing?WT.mc_id=AI-MVP-5004204\">one way to support secure multi-party machine learning</a>.

ADT is an Intelligent Cloud platform provided by Microsoft that allows you to represent real-world things digitally. Every detail can be recorded, tracked, and inspected digitally to give an overview of the state of, places, devises, business processes, and people. At the heart of ADT is the spatial intelligence graphs used to model relationships and interactions between twins.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Innovative AI solutions require innovative data storage solutions. In a multi agent world where lots of individual ‘thoughts’ are processing, sometimes simultaneously, it is easy to imagine that it gets difficult to keep track of data. ADT allows us to treat the agent system in an easy to visualise way which mimics the structure of biological brains. Events and actions taken by agents, result in ‘memories’ of data. This data may be useful, or it may be junk, but in order to ‘learn’ it is important for us to assess mistakes as well as successes. Events can be linked to one another, creating a logical pathway of events that occurred, and the data that was produced.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For more information about Digital Twins for Thinking Machines, the blog post is available in full at  <a href=\"https://www.avanade.com/en/blogs/techs-and-specs/data-and-analytics/thinking-machines-azure-digital-twins\">https://www.avanade.com/en/blogs/techs-and-specs/data-and-analytics/thinking-machines-azure-digital-twins</a>   - for ADT itself, Microsoft&#x27;s documentation is <em>the place</em> to start reading up.</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/digital-twins/overview?WT.mc_id=AI-MVP-5004204\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\"><p>What is Azure Digital Twins? - Azure Digital Twins</p></div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\"><p>Overview of what can be done with Azure Digital Twins.</p></div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-metadata\"><span class=\"kg-bookmark-author\">Microsoft Docs</span><span class=\"kg-bookmark-publisher\">baanders</span></div></div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-thumbnail\"><img src=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/media/logos/logo-ms-social.png\" alt=\"\"/></div></a></figure>",

This has really brought out that team spirit, but some people are pretty busy.</p>\n<p>Sending a notification to people that haven&#x27;t had the time to log their steps is the perfect type of notification to send via Teams - short, sharp, targeted, and actionable.</p>\n<h2>What does this use?</h2>\n<p>I&#x27;ll be using the <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/teams/?WT.mc_id=AI-MVP-5004204\">Microsoft Teams</a> connector for Power Automate.

This can involve a developer co-pilot or an ‘AI pair programming’\napproach that flags poor development practices or proposes alternative ways to\nsolve a problem.</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><strong>What is it?</strong><br/><p>This approach provides additional support for existing developers, providing\nanswers to write complex algorithms, trained on other “best of breed”\ncodebases. It also enables new developers to become productive on domain\nspecific code, or closed enterprise owned codebases. Long story short, this is\nnot an update to automatic code generation, but it is about providing support\nin what and how to develop next. AI becomes your assistant, rather than\nreplacing human ingenuity.</p></blockquote>\n<p><p>For more information about Intelligent Code Creation tools, the blog post is\navailable in full at </p><a href=\"https://www.avanade.com/en/blogs/techs-and-specs/software-development/intelligent-code-creation\"><p><a href=\"https://www.avanade.com/en/blogs/techs-and-specs/software-development/intelligent-code-creation\">https://www.avanade.com/en/blogs/techs-and-specs/software-development/intelligent-code-creation</a></p></a></p>",

These are passed on through word of mouth, from\ngeneration to generation.</p></p>\n<p><p>This means that societies create customs and social norms, but they are only\nknown by those people who are taught the norms. These can&#x27;t be found - they\nneed to be taught. This is a slow process, and contrary to the way mass media\nworks today.</p></p>\n<p><p>The rise of literacy has led to stability - it&#x27;s given us the written word,\nand accountability. Literacy allows for us to see what our leaders get up to,\nhow we follow ethical standards, how we make sure the law is applied equally\nto all, in a non-arbitrary fashion.</p></p>\n<p><p>Mass media allows for broader society to be engaged and react, as opposed to\ntools like clubhouse, which are very &quot;in the moment&quot; tools, and close off the\npool of activities and cultural processes like innovation.</p></p>\n<p><p>If we take the very shaky premise that all progress is good progress - or even\nsay <em>some </em>progress is better than none - I think society benefits from\nan open pool of innovation, and literacy allows us to include more groups than\nthose we exclude.</p></p>\n<h3 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h3>\n<p><p>My main conclusion is - Clubhouse is a good thing. It&#x27;s another medium for\ndebate.</p></p>\n<p><p>I worry that too much of a shift to oral culture, with limited recording and\ntransmission, or participation via text, will limit societal revolution and\nchanges.</p></p>\n<p><p>Zeynep talks about a tension between literate classes that hold power - I&#x27;d\nalso say that literacy enfranchises some previously excluded elements of\nsociety, and it&#x27;s one to watch.</p></p>",

I found a great package by BK Lim, but there isn&#x27;t an official SDK.</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><div class=\"kg-gallery-container\"><div class=\"kg-gallery-row\"><div class=\"kg-gallery-image\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/02/Screenshot-2021-02-18-at-20.31.12.png\" width=\"1280\" height=\"1008\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/Screenshot-2021-02-18-at-20.31.12.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/Screenshot-2021-02-18-at-20.31.12.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/02/Screenshot-2021-02-18-at-20.31.12.png 1280w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"/></div><div class=\"kg-gallery-image\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/02/Screenshot-2021-02-18-at-20.31.40.png\" width=\"1628\" height=\"1576\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/Screenshot-2021-02-18-at-20.31.40.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/Screenshot-2021-02-18-at-20.31.40.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1600/2021/02/Screenshot-2021-02-18-at-20.31.40.png 1600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/02/Screenshot-2021-02-18-at-20.31.40.png 1628w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"/></div></div></div><figcaption>A social video project I&#x27;ve been working on</figcaption></figure>\n<p><p>For most purposes, BK Lim&#x27;s library would be great, but with the number of\nqueries and callbacks I expected, being able to run the library asynchronously\nfor me was a must.</p></p>\n<h3 id=\"aio-videoindexer-allows-you-to-use-azure-media-services-in-python\"><p>aio-videoindexer allows you to use Azure Media Services in Python</p></h3>\n<p><p>I thought it might be useful for others, so I&#x27;ve spun the library out into \n<a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/aio-videoindexer/\">a package on PyPy</a>.</p></p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://pypi.org/project/aio-videoindexer/\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">aio-videoindexer</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\"><p>An async video indexer package for querying Microsoft Media Services\nVideo Indexer in Python.</p></div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-metadata\"><img class=\"kg-bookmark-icon\" src=\"https://pypi.org/static/images/favicon.6a76275d.ico\"/><span class=\"kg-bookmark-author\">PyPI</span></div></div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-thumbnail\"><img src=\"https://pypi.org/static/images/twitter.90915068.jpg\"/></div></a></figure>\n<p>This doesn&#x27;t implement the full range of the <a href=\"https://api-portal.videoindexer.ai/docs/services/Operations/operations/Get-Video-Access-Token?\">Video Indexer Operations API</a>\n, but for uploading from blob storage, getting video display widgets, and listing\nout video information - this should be a good start!</p>\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/Sealjay-clj/0e1273cc038646a81c0aac482b9ca170.js\"></script>\n<p>I&#x27;ve added <a href=\"https://aio-videoindexer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\">basic documentation to\nReadTheDocs,</a> and you can\nsee this package in action in <a href=\"https://github.com/sealjay-clj/teams-vid\">the Teams-Vid\nrepository</a> .

You know how it is - <em>am I allowed to talk about this</em>?</p>\n<p>Well, I have permission to share (some) of what I&#x27;ve been working on! This will be less code heavy, but I&#x27;ll explain how a brand new solution would work in practice, and what the architecture would look like.</p>\n<p>The impact of this approach can be phenomenal - I was part of a team working with a large financial services company to index their documents, and we saw new starters save <strong>53 seconds per search</strong> when finding new documents.

At the time of creating this solution, there was no SharePoint connector for Cognitive Search - so we copied the entirety of the library to be indexed to Blob Storage, and then created a Logic App to copy new and updated files to Blob Storage as it happened.</p>\n<h3>Intelligence</h3>\n<p>We created an Azure Function that accepted input from Cognitive Search at the Document Cracking phase, and then sent this to the Agolo <a href=\"https://dev.agolo.com/docs/services/570d7b4f88b6e5116cdf6a17/operations/570d7b5188b6e508dcfb1c90\">Bullet Summarizer API</a> to be summarised.

This Azure Function is registered as a <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/cognitive-search-custom-skill-web-api\">Custom Web API</a>.</p>\n<p>We then used the <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/cognitive-search-predefined-skills#built-in-skills\">built-in skills</a> for Computer Vision and Text Analytics.</p>\n<h3>Indexing the files</h3>\n<p>We created an <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/search-get-started-portal\">Index in Cognitive Search</a> which used the Blob Storage as a data source.</p>\n<p>As part of the indexing process, the Cognitive Skills we added earlier, and the Custom Skill we created, are applied to the documents, to produce an index.</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/02/image-21.png\" class=\"kg-image\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1236\" height=\"244\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/image-21.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/image-21.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/02/image-21.png 1236w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"/><figcaption>The Document Cracking Pipeline for this Solution</figcaption></figure>\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/Sealjay-clj/428a5b9451241b7247abc8a1a718af0f.js\"></script>\n<p><p>And there we have it!

Most of the intelligence takes place in Bing Search, and then Click is used to generate a CLI.  <a href=\"https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x/\">Click is a Python package</a>   focussed on creating command line interfaces.</p>\n<p>The command line has three options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Search by Category. <em>Example:</em>  <code>python3 bingnews.py cat -c Business</code></li>\n<li>Search by Phrase. <em>Example:</em>  <code>python3 bingnews.py phrase -p &quot;Future of Computing&quot;</code></li>\n<li>Search for Trending articles. <em>Example:</em>  <code>python3 bingnews.py trend</code></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>The basic request</h4>\n<p>The basic request is made up of the <code>search_and_output_bing</code>  function, which is called for all of the various API queries.</p>\n<p>This queries the Bing News endpoint, and then requests that the output is printed with <code>print_bing_results</code>, which in turn formats the output for presentation in <code>clean_bing_article_list</code>, applying some tweaks for the varied result-set returned by trending articles, in  <code>clean_trending_article_dictionary</code>.</p>\n \n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/Sealjay-clj/e8a708866732ccd479a9cf069cfc84a3.js\"></script>\n \n<h4>Composing functions with Click</h4>\n<p>In order to make functions available on the command-line, <code>click</code> allows us to use decorators to automatically generate help information for the command line, pass arguments to the function, and provide prompts if information is not provided by the user. Some defaults are also provided which can be overridden on the command-line, such as defaulting to the <code>en-GB</code> locale.</p>\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/Sealjay-clj/a96bc2ddfd16fbbc3173f22f603c0e15.js\"></script>\n<h3>Other Components</h3>\n<h5>Requests Caching</h5>\n<p>Requests are cached for five minutes, in case the user runs the same search, or in case the shortener is provided similar news article URLs, to prevent requesting the same URL twice for shortening from an endpoint.</p>\n<h5>Tabulate</h5>\n<p>Tabulate is used to render the dictionary output from the API, and make it easily readable in the terminal.</p>\n<h5>PyShorteners</h5>\n<p>URLs provided by Bing News are shortened with the <code>pyshorteners</code> package,and the qpsru service, to ensure they don&#x27;t wrap off the terminal, and break the link.</p>\n<h3>What packages does this use</h3>\n<p>The key packages are as follows:</p>\n<table><thead><tr><th>Package Name</th><th>Purpose</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>click</td><td>Handles the CLI functionality</td></tr><tr><td>tabulate</td><td>Formats the results as a table</td></tr><tr><td>python-dotenv</td><td>Retrieves the configuration values from the .env file</td></tr><tr><td>requests</td><td>Handles the API request</td></tr><tr><td>requests-cache</td><td><p>Caches the requests if we make the same query, or shorten the same URL\n(pyshorteners is <a href=\"https://github.com/ellisonleao/pyshorteners/blob/master/pyshorteners/base.py\">based on the requests\npackage</a>\nas well, and the qspru shortener uses GET requests)</p></td></tr><tr><td>pyshorteners</td><td><p>Shortens the URls - I use psru, as this shortener doesn&#x27;t require an API\nkey</p></td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h3>What next?</h3>\n<p>If you were to use this frequently in production, you&#x27;d want to add tests, and install this locally with a <code>setup.py</code> file. But for now, it&#x27;s a good start for a CLI that can be re-used - and I&#x27;ll be extending the functionality in a future post.</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading, and I hope you found this interesting!</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/02/image-13.png\" class=\"kg-image\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"913\" height=\"289\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/image-13.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/02/image-13.png 913w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"/><figcaption>Time to go and catch up on Science and Technology!</figcaption></figure>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card kg-card-hascaption\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/bing-web-search/\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\"><p>Bing Search API documentation - Azure Cognitive Services</p></div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\"><p>The Bing Search APIs let you build web-connected apps and services that\nfind webpages, images, news, locations, and more without advertisements.</p></div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-metadata\"><span class=\"kg-bookmark-author\">Microsoft Docs</span><span class=\"kg-bookmark-publisher\">aahill</span></div></div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-thumbnail\"><img src=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/media/logos/logo-ms-social.png\"/></div></a><figcaption>Find out more about the Bing Search API</figcaption></figure>",
