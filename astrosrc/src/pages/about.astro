            I work at Avanade - I&apos;m the Head of Open Innovation, which
            means focussing on an ecossytem of academia, foundations, and
            start-ups; it also encompasses Avanadeâ€™s Open-Source projects office
            and developer relations team.
          </p>
          <p>
            I started my career working in local government, with a brief stint
            at the Financial Ombudsman Service. I transitioned careers, and
            since then I&apos;ve focussed on data, analytics, and emerging
            technologies.
          </p>
          <p>
            These days, I focus on scaling capabilities, or working with open
            source organisations like the TODO Group, the Green Software
            Foundation, and LF Europe.
          </p>
          <p>
            I&apos;m a Microsoft MVP in AI, the Chief Blueprints Officer for
            OpenUK, as well as supporting various roles at the Green Software
            Foundation: the Vice-Chair of the Oversight Committee, Co-Chair of
            the Open Source Working Group, and a Steering Committee member.
