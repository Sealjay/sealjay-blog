Following my blog post about MIT Future Compute, I co-authored a more in depth article about cloud tech trends and connectivity [for Avanade Techs and Specs.](https://www.avanade.com/en/blogs/techs-and-specs/quantum-computing/mit-future-compute)

[What’s on the horizon? 2021 and beyondI was lucky enough to attend MIT Future Compute 2021, to understand theconvergence of various technologies, from the Internet of Things to new(-ish)connectivity options, like 5G and LoRaWAN. Future Compute 2021An examination of the computing landscape, hosted online byMIT Technology Review Febru…![](https://sealjay.com/favicon.png)SealjayChris Lloyd-Jones![](https://static.ghost.org/v3.0.0/images/publication-cover.png)](https://sealjay.com/whats-on-the-horizon-2021-mit-future-compute/)The blog covers cloud, 5G, sustainability, quantum, classical compute.


> If you read nothing else – then know this: everything is converging. AI and Machine Learning infused the picture from every commentator – and this demonstrates to us that now is an inflection point, where great things will be created through the combination, re-combination and experimentation of these technologies.


> We don’t know where everything will land, but the impact of connectivity, and sovereign internet, led us to posit four scenarios:  
> 1. Collaborative Outputs – Knowledge workers leave the city, and work in a globalized highly connected world  
> 2. Global villages – Cities remain collaborative hubs for new ventures and technologies, with digital third spaces focusing on messaging  
> 3. Fragmented tribes – Travel becomes limited, and data fragments with the imposition of internal walls to accommodate data sovereignty within corporations, leading to competing standards for data sharing  
> 4. Urban foxes – Travel resurges, and corporations re-adapt to cross-border working, with connectivity focusing on the last mile, supporting the Intelligent Edge.
