This week at at Microsoft Ignite, [Pablo Castro and Jeremy Chapman](https://myignite.microsoft.com/sessions/cb258175-2e65-49fe-919c-23c88dca54c7?source=sessions) covered some [amazing new additions to Azure Cognitive Search](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-ai/introducing-semantic-search-bringing-more-meaningful-results-to/ba-p/2175636) - including semantic search, semantic answers, and semantic questions! Everything is semantic!

Semantic Search allows you to offer better answers to search queries, really blowing pure keyword based ranking out of the water. The ranking algorithm tries to rank articles, based on how well they actually answer a query.

The idea behind semantic search is try to understand _what the user wants to_ achieve - this leverages investments from Bing, and Microsoft Research, to bring the best of other solutions together.

I previously posted about unlocking content using Azure Cognitive Search - and Semantic Search puts these ideas on steroids!

[Unlocking content using Azure Cognitive Search, and AgoloUsing Azure Cognitive Search to index information within a document store, and make it more easily comprehensible & accessible![](https://sealjay.com/favicon.png)SealjayChris Lloyd-Jones![](/images/2021/02/cogsearchmain-1.png)](https://sealjay.com/unlocking-content-with-summaries-and-insight/)The problem with a pure keyword search, is that computers don't understand the context they're operating in. If you search for an orange, you'll get results for the fruit, mixed in with the colour.

For a single keyword, that's fine - but semantic search really helps with areas that get much more difficult.

Semantic Search makes it possible to understand links across text in a document, adding Semantic Answers -  allowing you to identify answers in a passage, or maybe figure out the questions that a document is posing, and therefore what a person might search for.

This means we can actually show relevant passages from documents in context, and hopefully answer a user right in the search results.

This is a really important extension to Azure Cognitive Search, and [now this is in public preview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/search/semantic-search-overview), I'm looking forward to getting my hands on this, so I can show you how to use this yourself!

## Want to know more?

I'll be demonstrating Semantic Search as part of a six-part series on rolling your own Azure Cognitive Search application!
