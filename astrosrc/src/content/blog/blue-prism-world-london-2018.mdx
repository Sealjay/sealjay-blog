I presented on the work my team had completed to:

- Build [the first Microsoft cognitive service integration for Blue Prism](https://www.avanade.com/404?item=web%3a%7bAA4D08D2-9DEE-4772-9270-80E747CFBADC%7d%40en)
- Create continuous integration from Blue Prism to Git ([even more timely as Github joins the Microsoft fold](https://news.microsoft.com/2018/06/04/microsoft-to-acquire-github-for-7-5-billion/))
- [Become the first Global Systems Integrator Authorized Training partner for Blue Prism](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/avanade-first-global-systems-integrator-si-to-become-authorized-training-partner-for-blue-prism-300664404.html)
