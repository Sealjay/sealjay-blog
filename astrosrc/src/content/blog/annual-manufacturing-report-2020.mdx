> **Chris Lloyd Jones,** Global Emerging Technology and Engineering Leader, at digital and cloud services company **[Avanade](https://www.avanade.com/en-gb/about-avanade)**, which sponsored the chapter, said, “Industry 4.0 is not the end game for industrial digitalisation. In today’s world of perpetual change, the solution is not another industrial revolution, but a transformation of products and how we make them.

> “We call this Industry X.0. Using new technologies like IoT, analytics, AI and digital twin, manufacturers can unlock new revenue and work with customers, employees and partners on a whole new level.”
