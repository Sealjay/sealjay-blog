I co-authored{' '} [a blog for Avanade Techs and Specs](https://www.avanade.com/en/blogs/techs-and-specs/data-and-analytics/thinking-machines-azure-digital-twins) , with a particular focus on Azure Digital Twins for AI and Machine Learning.

> We used{' '} [Azure Digital Twins (ADT)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/digital-twins?WT.mc_id=AI-MVP-5004204) {' '} to provide memory for our thinking machines, to add context. ADT is an Intelligent Cloud platform provided by Microsoft that allows you to represent real-world things digitally. Every detail can be recorded, tracked, and inspected digitally to give an overview of the state of, places, devises, business processes, and people. At the heart of ADT is the spatial intelligence graphs used to model relationships and interactions between twins.

> Innovative AI solutions require innovative data storage solutions. In a multi agent world where lots of individual ‘thoughts’ are processing, sometimes simultaneously, it is easy to imagine that it gets difficult to keep track of data. ADT allows us to treat the agent system in an easy to visualise way which mimics the structure of biological brains. Events and actions taken by agents, result in ‘memories’ of data. This data may be useful, or it may be junk, but in order to ‘learn’ it is important for us to assess mistakes as well as successes. Events can be linked to one another, creating a logical pathway of events that occurred, and the data that was produced.

For more information about Digital Twins for Thinking Machines, the blog post is available in full at{' '} [https://www.avanade.com/en/blogs/techs-and-specs/data-and-analytics/thinking-machines-azure-digital-twins](https://www.avanade.com/en/blogs/techs-and-specs/data-and-analytics/thinking-machines-azure-digital-twins) {' '} - for ADT itself, Microsoft's documentation is _the place_ to start reading up.
