<blockquote>
  If you read nothing else – then know this: everything is converging. AI and
  Machine Learning infused the picture from every commentator – and this
  demonstrates to us that now is an inflection point, where great things will be
  created through the combination, re-combination and experimentation of these
  technologies.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  We don’t know where everything will land, but the impact of connectivity, and
  sovereign internet, led us to posit four scenarios:
  <br />
  1. Collaborative Outputs – Knowledge workers leave the city, and work in a
  globalized highly connected world
  <br />
  2. Global villages – Cities remain collaborative hubs for new ventures and
  technologies, with digital third spaces focusing on messaging
  <br />
  3. Fragmented tribes – Travel becomes limited, and data fragments with the
  imposition of internal walls to accommodate data sovereignty within
  corporations, leading to competing standards for data sharing
  <br />
  4. Urban foxes – Travel resurges, and corporations re-adapt to cross-border
  working, with connectivity focusing on the last mile, supporting the
  Intelligent Edge.
