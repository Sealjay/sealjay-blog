import { ArticleLayout } from '@/components/ArticleLayout'

export const meta = {

If you're like me, you probably wish you got less email! But, equally, you don't want to tag a whole group of people in Teams either - starting a whole discussion.

Sometimes I find myself needing to send an urgent message to a group of people, but I want to make sure each individual gets it as a message.

So, I thought I'd share a handy approach to this using Power Automate, in case this comes in handy for you!

**Caveat:** make sure you don't overuse this, or send notifications to an overly broad set of users. Over communication can switch your users off from your messages!

## Context

At my organisation, we're currently having an internal competition - right now, we're competing for the most steps! This has really brought out that team spirit, but some people are pretty busy.

Sending a notification to people that haven't had the time to log their steps is the perfect type of notification to send via Teams - short, sharp, targeted, and actionable.

## What does this use?

I'll be using the [Microsoft Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/teams/?WT.mc_id=AI-MVP-5004204) connector for Power Automate. I'll send an Adaptive Card to a user from the Flow Bot, with an actionable link - falling back to an email if the Flow Bot is blocked. (One reason not to spam your users!)

[Adaptive Cards](https://adaptivecards.io/) allows us to write JSON snippets, which are then translated into the native UI of the platform that your message is being received in.

How do we do it? ----------------

I'll assume you have some basic familiarity with Power Automate - and if not, Microsoft has just released a '[30 days to learn it](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/offers/30-days-to-learn-it)' learning path for the Power Platform, which covers just these topics!

At a high level, the process is this:

- Get the users in a group.
- Set a template for the adaptive card, the email fallback, and choose the title.
- Loop through the users, and try to send the adaptive card.
- If the user has the bot blocked, send the email.

I'll be using a recurring trigger, so I can send this on a weekly basis. In the real-life scenario, I'm also checking to see if the user has posted steps - I've omitted that here for clarity.

## Setting up the automation

I've gone to [flow.microsoft.com](https://flow.microsoft.com/) and logged into my account.

I'll click 'Create' on the left-hand side and choose 'Scheduled cloud flow.'

<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption">

    src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/03/image-19.png"

    width="542"
    height="416"
  />
  <figcaption>

  </figcaption>
</figure>
Complete the form and select how often you'd like the flow to run.

## Defining your messages

Before we go any further, it's worth figuring out what messages you'll send.

### Adaptive Card

My adaptive card has a title, a short description, and a button for the user to take action.

<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card">
  <img
    src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/03/image-20.png"
    class="kg-image"

    width="950"
    height="648"
    srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2021/03/image-20.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/03/image-20.png 950w"
    sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"
  />
</figure>
There are [tons of samples](https://adaptivecards.io/samples/Restaurant.html) to
choose from on the adaptive cards site - and you can click 'Try it yourself' to edit
a card in a WYSIWYG editor.

You can see the code for my card here:

```
{
  "type": "AdaptiveCard",
  "body": [
    {
      "type": "TextBlock",
      "size": "ExtraLarge",
      "weight": "Bolder",
      "text": "Your steps are needed!"
    },
    {
      "type": "ColumnSet",
      "columns": [
        {
          "type": "Column",
          "items": [
            {
              "type": "Image",
              "style": "Person",
              "url": "https://demeliou.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/marie-curie.jpg",
              "size": "Large"
            }
          ],
          "width": "auto"
        },
        {
          "type": "Column",
          "items": [
            {
              "type": "TextBlock",
              "weight": "Bolder",
              "text": "Logging just one step matters!",
              "wrap": true
            },
            {
              "type": "TextBlock",
              "text": "We have the highest average steps per day... in it to WIN it! If everyone in the team logged, we'd be top of the leaderboard.",
              "wrap": true
            },
            {
              "type": "TextBlock",
              "text": "Don't let the rest of House Curie down, any step logged is a step forward!",
              "wrap": true
            }
          ],
          "width": "stretch"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "actions": [
    {
      "type": "Action.OpenUrl",
      "title": "Log your steps!",
      "url": "https://www.google.com"
    }
  ],
  "$schema": "http://adaptivecards.io/schemas/adaptive-card.json",
  "version": "1.2"
}
```

The key point here is the button - created right at the bottom, as an `Action.OpenUrl` type. You'll also notice that my adaptive card doesn't separate the data from the template, as the Flow Bot currently doesn't support this.

### Email

I used an [online HTML editor](https://html-online.com/editor/) to create a very basic email template, with the same call to action - as well as a short explanatory note as to why the user is receiving the email.

You can see the HTML I used here:

```
<h1>Your team need you!</h1>
<table style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%;" border="1">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="width: 60.634%;">
<p>We have the highest average steps per day... in it to WIN it! If everyone in the team logged, we'd be top of the leaderboard</p>
<p>Don't let the rest of the team downdown, any step logged is a step forward!</p>
<p>Logging just one step matters!</p>
</td>
<td style="width: 39.366%;"><img src="https://demeliou.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/marie-curie.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="200" /></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><a href="dummylink">Click Here to log your Steps</a></p>
<hr />
<p><em>We know you're busy, and would rather not bother you. We've semt this email because you have <a href="https://flow.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/microsoft-flow-in-microsoft-teams/">the Flow Bot</a> blocked in Microsoft Teams.&nbsp;</em></p>
```

<p>Here's what the user would receive:</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption">
  <img
    src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/03/image-21.png"

    sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"
  />
  <figcaption>An email from the automation</figcaption>
</figure>
Assuming the title is pretty explanatory, I'll create three compose actions, and
add in my adaptive card, my email, and my title.
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption">

    sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"
  />
  <figcaption>
    You can see the recurrence trigger, the adaptive card, the email content,
    and the title.
  </figcaption>
</figure>
Looping over the users ----------------------

Now we need to get all of the users in the group I want to message, and then iterate over them!

I use the 'List group members' connector to get the users in the group.

<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card">
  <img
    src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/03/image-23.png"
    class="kg-image"
    alt
    loading="lazy"
    width="1248"
    height="334"
    srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2021/03/image-23.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2021/03/image-23.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/03/image-23.png 1248w"
    sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"
  />
</figure>
I then create an 'Apply to each' action, and add the 'value' of the 'List group members'
action to the selected output.
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card">
  <img
    src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/03/image-24.png"
    class="kg-image"
    alt
    loading="lazy"
    width="610"
    height="290"
    srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2021/03/image-24.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/03/image-24.png 610w"
  />
</figure>
<h2 id="sending-the-messages-and-the-fallback">
  Sending the messages - and the fallback
</h2>
<h3 id="the-adaptive-card">The Adaptive Card</h3>
<p>
  To send the Adaptive card, I search for the 'Post your own adaptive card as
  the Flow bot to a user' action, under the Teams connector.
</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card">
  <img
    src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/03/image-30.png"
    class="kg-image"

    sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"
  />
</figure>
Once this is created, I insert the Mail variable, for the users email - and I then
insert the data I pre-prepared, with the advanced options expanded.

- Recipient - Place the Mail output, with the users email
- Message - Place the Adapative Cards output
- Headline - I use the Title output
- Summary - I tend to use the Title output again
- IsAlert - I select 'Yes'

<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card">

<h3 id="and-the-email-fallback">And... the email fallback</h3>
<p>This is probably the trickiest bit, to be honest.</p>
<p>
  Create a 'condition' action, and in the left hand side of the condition, 'Add
  dynamic content', select 'Expression' and then enter
  `outputs('Post_your_own_adaptive_card_as_the_Flow_bot_to_a_user')?['statusCode']`
  in the box. If you renamed the action after making it, you'll need to update
  here too.
</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card">

    sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"
  />
</figure>
<p>
  Once that's complete, enter 403 in the right hand side - so your condition
  should be checking whether the status code from posting via the Flow bot, is
  equal to 403.
</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card">
