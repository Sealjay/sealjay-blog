<p>
  I've spent a lot of time recently, trying to understand open source models,
  and how they cover their costs. I personally <strong>love </strong>open
  source, and the community around it.
</p>
<p>
  But - I think many of us have a tacit understanding of Open Source, and how it
  works, and I thought I'd try and put that down in writing. Without
  understanding how it works now, I think it's hard to consider how it should
  work in the future.
</p>
<p>
  I'm interested in your thoughts, please feel free to reach out on twitter!

  A byproduct of the work an organisation needs to do, to get their job done.
  For example, Spinnaker was created by Netflix to deliver software, and was
  later adopted by Google. Bootstrap is one of the most used web frameworks, and
  was called “Twitter Blueprint” before being open sourced externally.

  <em>

  </em>
  Intentionally created by individuals or foundations with an eye to open
  sourcing from the-get go. This tends to lead to a collegiate development
  process, with heavy not-for-profit links. For example, the Apache Software
  foundation maintains Kafka, and the Linux Foundation grows Linux.

  <em>

  </em>
  Sponsored and supported by a corporation or enterprise with a vested interest
  in the success of a technology. For example, Docker and Elastic search promote
  an open source community, but broadly speaking, they own the roadmap and the
  development of the software.
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    Low Corporate Heritage / High Corporate Ownership - Pushed to the side
    -{' '}
  </em>
  A corporation that has a vested interest in the success of a technology, but
  wants the open source community to buy-in to it. For example, the .NET
  foundation was created by Microsoft to contribute and own the .NET framework,
  including related projects like C# .NET core.

  Generally initial corporate coverage, then when the product no longer has
  corporate usage, it either gets adopted by an open source community, or it
  dies.

  <em>

  These projects are generally not-for-profits, relying on donations, academic
  grants, and sponsorship from enterprises that use the software.
</p>
<p>
  <em>

  </em>
  Funds from the corporation producing the software - commonly the corporation
  provides a SaaS cloud hosting option, or requests donations for paid features.
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    Low Corporate Heritage / High Corporate Ownership - Pushed to the side

  </em>
  Generally the corporation is trying to use the software to promote another aim
  - such as Azure Cloud Revenue, or the use of AWS. The corporation funds the
  project to indirectly support the aim.
