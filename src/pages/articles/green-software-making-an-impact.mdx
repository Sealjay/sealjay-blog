I've been absolutely chuffed to be part of the Green Software Foundation, as one of the many members and contributors to{' '} [the Software Carbon Intensity specification](https://greensoftware.foundation/projects/software-carbon-intensity-sci-specification) .

From my perspective, the overall goal of the specification is to drive action to reduce the carbon impact of the software in the world around us. Many of us have taken a module on software profiling at university - using{' '} [tools like gprof](https://ftp.gnu.org/old-gnu/Manuals/gprof-2.9.1/html_mono/gprof.html#SEC1) {' '} to track the performance of software, and identify areas for rewriting and refactoring, to improve software speed.

<p>
  Until now though, how many of us actually go and do this? The glut of cheaply
  available compute has made us somewhat spoilt - and I'd boldly say (or
  whisper) lazy at times.
</p>
<p>
  Carbon emissions of our software changes this imperative. It isn't just
  important to refactor software for speed and efficiency, but also to improve
  the electrical performance, and thus potentially the carbon emissions
  generated by running software.

  Standing on the shoulders of many others in the foundation, the specification
  itself describes three actions that should be taken to reduce the carbon
  emissions of software:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Energy Efficiency: Actions taken to make software use less electricity to
      perform the same function.
    </li>
    <li>
      Hardware Efficiency: Actions taken to make software use less physical
      resources to perform the same function.
    </li>
    <li>
      Carbon Awareness: Actions taken to time or region-shift software
      computation to take advantage of clean, renewable or low carbon sources of
      electricity.
    </li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

  , <em>
    Green Software Foundation, . (2021). Software Carbon Intensity Standard
    (Version 1.0.0)
  </em>)
</p>
<p>These actions can come in many forms.</p>
<h3 id="energy-efficiency">Energy Efficiency</h3>
<p>
  For cloud aficionados, energy efficiency can be approached both by improving
  the efficiency of the underlying software (or using{' '}
  <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/applications/machine-learning/preprocess-data/transfer-learning-tensorflow?WT.mc_id=AI-MVP-5004204">
    techniques like transfer learning when training a machine learning model
  </a>
  ), but also by rightsizing the cloud infrastructure being used. For example, Sara
  Bergman <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/sustainable-software/how-can-i-calculate-co2eq-emissions-for-my-azure-vm/?WT.mc_id=AI-MVP-5004204">
    has written an excellent article
  </a> on calculating the CO<sub>2</sub>eq of a virtual machine; using a similar
  formula, we can roughly estimate the CO<sub>2</sub>eq of a container, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/?WT.mc_id=AI-MVP-5004204">
    or an Azure Function
  </a>.
</p>
<p>
  Whilst the target figures are likely some way off from the reality (presumably
  only your cloud provider knows the true figures), we can be confident enough
  to say that Containers and Serverless Computing are likely significantly more
  energy &amp; carbon-efficient than running an application in a whole virtual
  machine.
</p>
<h3 id="hardware-efficiency">Hardware Efficiency</h3>
<p>
  Hardware efficiency in turn could mean moving to a cloud, with economies of
  scale, and the ability of a cloud provider to be carbon neutral.{' '}
  <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/compliance/assurance/assurance-datacenter-environmental-safeguards#energy-efficiency?WT.mc_id=AI-MVP-5004204">
    Microsoft commits to be carbon negative by 2030 for example
  </a>
  , and to remove all historic carbon since it was founded in 1975, by 2050.
</p>
<p>
  However, hardware efficiency could also include extending the life of your
  existing hardware. For example,{' '}
  <a href="https://www.opencompute.org/blog/open-compute-open-sustainability-open-possibilities">
    the Open Compute Project (OCP) has been looking at how to apply circular
    economic principles to your IT infrastructure
  </a>
  .
</p>
<h3 id="carbon-awareness">Carbon Awareness</h3>
<p>
  The final action that the specification describes, is Carbon Awareness. That
  is, knowing the current fuel mix of your energy grid, and running applications
  when the energy has been created through renewables, as opposed to fossil
  fuels.
</p>
<p>
  Some datacentres have private energy supplies; but others are connected to the
  public and national grid, in whatever country they happen to be located.
</p>
<p>
  For the UK, you can see the UK's energy fuel mix in real time at [the
  electricity
  info](https://electricityinfo.org/real-time-british-electricity-supply/){' '}
  website. At the time of writing, 22.7% of the UK's energy in the grid right
  now, is from renewable sources. In the last 24 hours, 43% of the energy came
  from renewable sources.
</p>
<p>
  If you can embed this awareness into your software, you can enable your
  software to lower its own emissions.{' '}
