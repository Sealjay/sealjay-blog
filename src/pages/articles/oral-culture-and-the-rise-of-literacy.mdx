  A colleague recently shared an interesting blog post about the historical
  anomaly of written culture - and it gave me a lot to think about. I liked many
  of the conclusions, but some elements need continued observation.

<h3 id="inclusion-in-the-workforce">Inclusion in the workforce</h3>
<p>
  I've sometimes wondered if the recent inclusion of different neurodiversities
  in the workforce &amp; society is down to acceptance, or if societal
  conditions were fertile by happenstance, rather than design.
</p>
<p>
  I posit that a rise in literate culture, while exclusionary to some with
  dyslexia (although this has improved over time with education and
  accessibility tools), allows people with non-traditional emotional &amp;
  communication norms to participate in discussions, eduction, activities, and
  events - without being seen as "slow" or "weird."
</p>
<p>
  Some communities with lower rates of diagnosis for autism and other
  communication differences, have higher rates of current oral tradition and
  usage.
</p>
<p>
  If I look at the rise of television culture, and the rise of radio - history
  shows that this affected popular perception of politicians, leading to an
  increase in photogenic politicians, and particularly the rise of people with
  the abilities to lead in public debate.
</p>
<p>
  I personally linked this to the idea that the medium began to matter as much
  as the message - and a return to Twitter and Email has added an element of
  healthy debate.
</p>
<h3 id="oral-traditions">Oral traditions</h3>
<p>
  Oral traditions are, exactly as the article intuits, a code of conduct in use
  across time and society. These are passed on through word of mouth, from
  generation to generation.
</p>
<p>
  This means that societies create customs and social norms, but they are only
  known by those people who are taught the norms. These can't be found - they
  need to be taught. This is a slow process, and contrary to the way mass media
  works today.
</p>
<p>
  The rise of literacy has led to stability - it's given us the written word,
  and accountability. Literacy allows for us to see what our leaders get up to,
  how we follow ethical standards, how we make sure the law is applied equally
  to all, in a non-arbitrary fashion.
</p>
<p>
  Mass media allows for broader society to be engaged and react, as opposed to
  tools like clubhouse, which are very "in the moment" tools, and close off the
  pool of activities and cultural processes like innovation.
</p>
<p>
  If we take the very shaky premise that all progress is good progress - or even
  say <em>some </em>progress is better than none - I think society benefits from
  an open pool of innovation, and literacy allows us to include more groups than
  those we exclude.
</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>
  My main conclusion is - Clubhouse is a good thing. It's another medium for
  debate.
</p>
<p>
  I worry that too much of a shift to oral culture, with limited recording and
  transmission, or participation via text, will limit societal revolution and
  changes.
</p>
<p>
  Zeynep talks about a tension between literate classes that hold power - I'd
  also say that literacy enfranchises some previously excluded elements of
  society, and it's one to watch.
