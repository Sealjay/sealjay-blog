  The podcast Environmental Variables, hosted by Asim Hussain, invited me to
  join as a guest! I joined as co-chair of the Open Source Working Group at the
  Green Software Foundation, with Dan Lewis-Toakley; Green Cloud Lead at
  ThoughtWorks, and also co-chair of the Open Source Working Group at the Green
  Software Foundation.

<p>
  We discussed the benefits of open source versus closed source, what tools are
  already out there and how open source can help reduce software emissions.
