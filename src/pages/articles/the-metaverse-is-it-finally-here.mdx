  Aside from (quite a few!) talks recently, around{' '}
  <a href="https://sealjay.com/querying-azure-digital-twins-with-powerbi/">
    querying Azure Digital Twins with PowerBI
  </a>
  , I've been pretty quiet. Why is that? Well, I'm finishing up my masters
  degree at the University of Edinburgh, focussed in the areas of AI, human
  interaction, and... how do we make human connections?
</p>
<p>
  So, why am I talking about this? Well as I've been working on my research,
  I've found that real life events are rapidly providing fodder, and almost too
  many topics and avenues to look at.
</p>
<h3 id="some-of-the-topics-ive-been-exploring-include">
  Some of the topics I've been exploring include...
</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Procedurally generating virtual spaces from a 3D map</li>
  <li>Using AI and ML to make virtual spaces seem real</li>
  <li>
    Connecting two physical spaces to make them feel seamlessly connected, like
    a window
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  And almost every single time, I find an open source project, or commercial
  research springing up to look in the same field. And that's amazing! I take it
  to mean I'm on the right track.

  , to devices from Google, Amazon and Facebook which connect two places... the
  main thread that seems to link these together, is that we're seeing an
  increase in services and design to provide security, trust, connection, and
  infrastructure to connect multiple parties across space.
</p>
<h2 id="the-metaverse">The Metaverse!</h2>
<p>
  This brings me to the Metaverse. The term Metaverse was coined by William
  Gibson, and in my opinion, is broadly used to refer to the totality of the
  world, connected and underpinned by the internet. For example, using augmented
  reality to navigate around a store, using virtual reality to host conferences,
  and <em>generally melding the physical and digital world into one</em>.
</p>
<p>
  I think we're now at the tipping point. We have competing standards to
  consider, competing technologies, but societal trends such as white-collar
  home working, digital driving licences, and the rise of interest communities
  as the main connector of people, rather than work, friends, or family seem to
  be bringing some version of the Metaverse to life.
</p>
<p>
  This brings problems - how do we include everyone? In the same way that
  Clubhouse, and similar audio tools can enfranchise and inadvertently
  disenfranchise groups... who is this excluding? But the future rushes towards
  us (whether or not we like it) - let's all keep an eye on progress, so we can
  share in a better future for all.

        The rise of clubhouse - and a return to oral culture. Literacy
        enfranchises some previously excluded elements of society, and this is a
        trend to watch.
