  I co-authored{' '}
  <a href="https://www.avanade.com/en/blogs/techs-and-specs/software-development/intelligent-code-creation">
    a blog for Avanade Techs and Specs
  </a>
  , focussing on Intelligent Code Creation tools, like Kite and Tabnine.

<blockquote>
  Intelligent code creation (ICC) uses machine learning models and embedded
  intelligence to provide developer support for writing secure best in class
  code. This can involve a developer co-pilot or an ‘AI pair programming’
  approach that flags poor development practices or proposes alternative ways to
  solve a problem.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <strong>What is it?</strong>
  <br />
  This approach provides additional support for existing developers, providing
  answers to write complex algorithms, trained on other “best of breed”
  codebases. It also enables new developers to become productive on domain
  specific code, or closed enterprise owned codebases. Long story short, this is
  not an update to automatic code generation, but it is about providing support
  in what and how to develop next. AI becomes your assistant, rather than
  replacing human ingenuity.
