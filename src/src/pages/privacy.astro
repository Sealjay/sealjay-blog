      <p>
        I am Chris Lloyd-Jones, also known online as Sealjay. This policy explains how I handle
        any personal information when you visit sealjay.com and its subdomains. The short
        version: I collect very little, I do not use cookies, and I do not track you.
      </p>

      <h2>What I collect</h2>
      <p>
        This site does not have user accounts, login forms, or contact forms. I do not
        ask for or store your personal information directly. The site does not set any
        cookies.
      </p>
      <p>
        A theme preference (light or dark mode) is saved in your browser's session
        storage. This stays on your device and is never sent to any server.
      </p>

      <h2>Analytics</h2>
      <p>
        I use <a href="https://plausible.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Plausible Analytics</a>
        to understand how the site is used. Plausible is a privacy-focused service that does
        not use cookies, does not collect personal data, and cannot identify individual
        visitors. It works by creating a daily hash from your IP address and browser
        information, which is rotated every 24 hours and cannot be used to track you across
        days. All analytics data is processed and stored in the EU (Hetzner, Germany).
      </p>

      <h2>Comments</h2>
      <p>
        Blog posts use <a href="https://giscus.app" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Giscus</a>,
        a commenting system powered by GitHub Discussions. When a page with comments loads,
        your browser makes requests to giscus.app (hosted on Vercel) and the GitHub API to
        display existing comments. This means your IP address and browser information are
        sent to those services, even if you do not interact with the comment section.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you choose to log in and leave a comment, you authenticate directly with GitHub
        using their OAuth process. Your GitHub profile information and comment content are
        then handled by GitHub under their own
        <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">privacy statement</a>.
        Giscus does not set cookies, but stores an authentication token in your browser's
        local storage if you log in.
      </p>

      <h2>Hosting</h2>
      <p>
        The site is hosted on Microsoft Azure Static Web Apps. I have not enabled any
        server-side monitoring or logging, so no visitor data (such as IP addresses or
        request logs) is collected or stored by the hosting platform.
      </p>

      <h2>External links</h2>
      <p>
        I link to other websites from time to time. Once you leave sealjay.com, those sites'
        own privacy policies apply. I am not responsible for how they handle your information.
      </p>

      <h2>Lawful basis</h2>
      <p>
        Where any personal data is processed (for example, IP addresses reaching third-party
        services listed above), the lawful basis under UK GDPR is <strong>legitimate
        interests</strong> (Article 6(1)(f)) &mdash; specifically, the interest in operating
        and improving this website. I do not rely on consent for any processing that happens
        automatically when you visit the site.
      </p>

      <h2>Your rights</h2>
      <p>
        Under UK data protection law, you have the right to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>ask what personal data I hold about you (right of access)</li>
        <li>ask me to correct inaccurate data (right to rectification)</li>
        <li>ask me to delete your data (right to erasure)</li>
        <li>ask me to restrict how I use your data (right to restriction)</li>
        <li>object to my processing of your data (right to object)</li>
        <li>receive your data in a portable format (right to data portability)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In practice, because this site collects very little personal data, most of these
        rights are unlikely to apply. But if you have a concern, please get in touch.
      </p>
      <h2>Get in touch</h2>
      <p>
        If you have questions about this policy or want to exercise any of your data rights,
        you can reach me on
