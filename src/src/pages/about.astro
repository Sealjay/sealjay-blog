          I work at Kyndryl as VP of AI Consulting Transformation, where I focus on driving AI strategy and transformation for enterprise clients globally. My role involves leading AI consulting initiatives, architecting scalable AI solutions, and helping organizations leverage artificial intelligence and emerging technologies to achieve their business goals.

          In my current position, I work across diverse technical domains—from cloud infrastructure and AI integration to sustainable software practices. I collaborate with teams globally to bring cutting-edge AI solutions to life, with a focus on open source technologies and green software principles.

          Previously, I served as Head of Avanade.ai and Head of Platforms &amp; Incubation at Avanade, where I led platform strategy and oversaw the incubations team and open source office. The incubation work involved nurturing early-stage ideas, products, and technologies—whether internal or via partnerships with start-ups and academia—providing structure, mentorship, and support to turn promising concepts into scalable business offerings.
        </p>

          I started my career in local government, including a stint at the Financial Ombudsman Service. I later transitioned to tech, where I've focused on data, analytics, and emerging technologies.

          My academic research explores how software can reduce carbon impact, using signals and evidence-based design to drive sustainability at scale. I'm also co-host of <a href="https://securing.quest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Securing the Realm</a>, a cybersecurity and Azure community initiative.
