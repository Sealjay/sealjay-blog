          I lead AI Consulting Transformation at Kyndryl, guiding how Artificial Intelligence is embedded across client experience, sales, service delivery, and innovation. My role is about building AI-native consulting practices that help organisations adopt technology responsibly, sustainably, and at scale.
        </p>
        <p>
          I stay hands-on with emerging tech—experimenting with open source projects, contributing to international standards, and shaping how AI is used securely and ethically. Recognised six times as a Microsoft MVP in Artificial Intelligence, I've also helped advance sustainability in software through the Green Software Foundation and ISO standards on Software Carbon Intensity.
        </p>
        <p>
          My journey in technology started young: from IRC bots and MUD servers at nine to co-developing a browser game at thirteen. After a stint in law, I returned to tech driven by a passion for making software better—through cleaner design, sustainability, and collaboration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Previously, I served as Head of Avanade.ai and Head of Platforms &amp; Incubation at Avanade, where I led platform strategy and oversaw the incubations team and open source office. The incubation work involved nurturing early-stage ideas, products, and technologies—whether internal or via partnerships with start-ups and academia—providing structure, mentorship, and support to turn promising concepts into scalable business offerings.
        </p>
        <p>
          I bring together business, design, and engineering to deliver AI solutions that are future-ready and practical—always with an eye on what's next. I'm also co-host of <a href="https://securing.quest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Securing the Realm</a>, a cybersecurity and Azure community initiative.
