          I lead AI Consulting Transformation at Kyndryl as VP, guiding how Artificial Intelligence is embedded across client experience, sales, service delivery, and innovation. My role is about building AI-native consulting practices that help organisations adopt technology responsibly, sustainably, and at scale.
        </p>
        <p>
          I stay hands-on with emerging tech, experimenting with open source projects, contributing to international standards, and shaping how AI is used securely and ethically. Recognised six times as a Microsoft MVP in Artificial Intelligence, I've also helped advance sustainability in software through the Green Software Foundation and as a contributor to <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/86612.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ISO/IEC 21031:2024</a>, the international standard for Software Carbon Intensity. I was recognised as an <a href="https://openuk.uk/honours/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenUK New Year's Honours 2025/26</a> recipient for contributions to open source.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm currently pursuing a doctorate in Data Science at the University of East London (2022–2027), with a research focus on Green Software Engineering and Green AI. You can find my research profile on <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7995-7865" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ORCID</a>.

          My journey in technology started young: from IRC bots and MUD servers at nine to co-developing a browser game at thirteen. After a stint in law, I returned to tech driven by a passion for making software better: cleaner design, sustainability, and collaboration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Previously, I served as Head of Avanade.ai and Head of Platforms &amp; Incubation at Avanade, where I led platform strategy and oversaw the incubations team and open source office. The incubation work involved nurturing early-stage ideas, products, and technologies, whether internal or via partnerships with start-ups and academia, providing structure, mentorship, and support to turn promising concepts into scalable business offerings.
        </p>
        <p>
          I bring together business, design, and engineering to deliver AI solutions that are future-ready and practical, always with an eye on what's next. I'm also co-host of <a href="https://securing.quest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Securing the Realm</a>, a cybersecurity and Azure community initiative.
