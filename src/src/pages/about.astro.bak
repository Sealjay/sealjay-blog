          I work at Avanade as the Head of Platforms &amp; Incubation, where I lead our platform strategy— designing, building, and scaling cloud-native solutions that integrate seamlessly across different services.</p>
          <p>I also oversee Avanade's incubations team, and our open source office, helping align our platform capabilities with both technical and business needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          The incubation side of my role involves nurturing early-stage ideas, products, and technologies— whether internal or via partnerships with start-ups and academia. I help bring these innovations to life by providing a structure, mentorship, and support to turn promising concepts into scalable business offerings.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started my career in local government, including a stint at the Financial Ombudsman Service. I later transitioned to tech, where I’ve focused on data, analytics, and emerging technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
          My academic research explores how software can reduce carbon impact, using signals and evidence-based design to drive sustainability at scale.
