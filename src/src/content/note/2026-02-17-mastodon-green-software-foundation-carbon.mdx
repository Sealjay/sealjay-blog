I mean open source projects where human SMEs take time to write a long specification, from data model to state machines. So at the green software foundation, we wrote the carbon intensity spec, with environmentalist SMEs and energy grid experts; after, we built an SDK to help people measure carbon. If these tools had existed, I would happily have tasked them to write from the human spec."
