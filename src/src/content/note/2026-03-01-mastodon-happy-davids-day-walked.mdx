description: "Happy St David's Day! 🌼
Walked the dog this morning and got to thinking about how different life looks now. Coming up to six months at Kyndryl.
Sometimes a career move pushes you right out of your comfort zone. I went from a Microsoft stack into leading Forward Deployed Engineers - and it's been fun to focus on an open source stack. Created the capability, now scaling it to 22,000 engineers.
Picking up dog poo keeps you grounded.
