description: "Attending the Conservative Party conference today - (attended lib dems, attending Labour too) - I’m worried broadly about #PostWork. Lots of focus on near term - my worry, what happens when opportunity is withdrawn from distressed regions? Say 2040, if we have a limited base of jobs… how do we handle upskilling, valuing following passion, access to resources?"
