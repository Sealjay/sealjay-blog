description: "I lost track of the semantic web somewhere around XHTML and RDF, and only came back to it recently while indieweb-ifying this site. Microformats like h-entry, h-card, and h-feed are VERY cool. Just add classes to do what RDF and friends were trying to do. So: JSON-LD powers schema.org for search engines, and IndieWeb community wired up Webmentions and Microsub readers on top of it. Elegantly markup becomes your API, without ontologies, SPARQL, or separate data layer. The utopian vision I loved had shipped out the door, excitingly I missed it ;)"
