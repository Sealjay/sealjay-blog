description: "How long does SaaS have left as a business model? Who will survive? I imagine we still need models now dven commoditised and open source. Probably compute and a trusted vendor for iam (or federated iam), data storage, with the complications of encryption, sovereign cloud and audit. But otherwise… why wouldn’t you build it yourself? I would say security and maintenance have been barriers to that in the past, but those barriers seem to be lowering by the week."
