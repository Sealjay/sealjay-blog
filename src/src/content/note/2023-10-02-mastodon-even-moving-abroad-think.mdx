description: "Even moving abroad, I think this will affect most societies, without a roadmap to equity and valuing all choices people make with their time. If we automate many roles - say leaving 20% of cognitively skilled roles\u2026 how should we value time? Maybe I'm being utopian, but if I still lived in a rural community; a coffee community hub, or many artists - they don't have the same access to resources as a tech startup. Our society doesn't currently value sustainable outcomes for everyone."
