Assuming you're using a Linux web application plan, and running a Python application that requires the use of Uvicorn, here are some tips.

You'll need to [have a startup command set in Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/app-service/configure-language-python?WT.mc_id=AI-MVP-5004204#customize-startup-command), which either calls a Uvicorn worker directly, or calls a configuration file specifying one.

![](/images/2021/02/image-2.png)On the Azure Portal, open your Web App, scroll to 'Configuration' under 'Settings', click on the 'General Settings' tab, and enter the appropriate startup command.`gunicorn -c gunicorn_config.py app:app`
TODO: Add caption
Once your startup command is set, you'll also need to have a gunicorn_config.py file in your web app deployment.

```
# Configuration for Gunicorn on Azure
# Azure Startup Command should be: gunicorn -c gunicorn_config.py app:app
# See: https://docs.gunicorn.org/en/stable/settings.html#config
workers = 4
worker_class = "uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker"

```

Finally, in your requirements.txt file, you'll need to specify additional dependencies:

```
# Required for deploying to Azure
uvicorn
uvloop
httptools

```
