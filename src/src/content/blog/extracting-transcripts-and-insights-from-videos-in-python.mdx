> **Update (February 2026):** [Azure Media Services was retired on 30 June 2024](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/media-services/latest/azure-media-services-retirement?WT.mc_id=AI-MVP-5004204). Video Indexer continues as a standalone service, now called [Azure AI Video Indexer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-video-indexer/video-indexer-overview?WT.mc_id=AI-MVP-5004204), operating independently of AMS. There is still no official Python SDK — the [REST API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-video-indexer/video-indexer-use-apis?WT.mc_id=AI-MVP-5004204) remains the primary integration method. The `aio-videoindexer` library mentioned below is no longer maintained.

Compared to YouTube from Google, and Twitch from Amazon, Microsoft's experiments with media have been... ill-feted in the past. From the shuttering of the Zune service in 2012, and the closure of the Mixer streaming service in July 2020, the track record doesn't look great.

**But** - Microsoft actually has a powerhouse of services for managing and handling video in the cloud. Enter [Azure Media Services Video Indexer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/media-services/video-indexer/) - a service which brings together the whole gamut of Azure Cognitive Services, including translation, and Computer Vision.

In the UK, we're still in lockdown due to the pandemic - so I've been trying to think of ways to help people stay connected, without burning out. This led me to work on a social video project to allow people to upload videos from their phone, automatically transcribing and posting them to teams.

In the course of this project (_more detail of which will be in a forthcoming blog post series, around deploying Python Web Applications to Azure_) - I realised that the Python SDK for Video Indexer is a bit lacking. I found a great package by BK Lim, but there isn't an official SDK.

### aio-videoindexer allows you to use Azure Media Services in Python

I thought it might be useful for others, so I've spun the library out into [a package on PyPy](https://pypi.org/project/aio-videoindexer/).

[aio-videoindexerAn async video indexer package for querying Microsoft Media Services Video Indexer in Python.![](https://pypi.org/static/images/favicon.6a76275d.ico)PyPI![](https://pypi.org/static/images/twitter.90915068.jpg)](https://pypi.org/project/aio-videoindexer/)This doesn't implement the full range of the [Video Indexer Operations API](https://api-portal.videoindexer.ai/docs/services/Operations/operations/Get-Video-Access-Token?), but for uploading from blob storage, getting video display widgets, and listing out video information - this should be a good start!

I've added [basic documentation to ReadTheDocs,](https://aio-videoindexer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and you can see this package in action in [the Teams-Vid repository](https://github.com/sealjay-clj/teams-vid). In an upcoming blog post, I'll show how Video Indexing can be used to power a social video application made with Python.
