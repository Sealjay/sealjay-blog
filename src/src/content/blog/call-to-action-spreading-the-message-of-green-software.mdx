I wrote [a blog for the Green Software Foundation](https://greensoftware.foundation/articles/call-to-action-spreading-the-message-of-green-software) - the start of a recurring series that I'm very excited about - Call to Action (CTA) -  practical steps for spreading the message of green software within organisations.
