I co-authored [a blog for Avanade Techs and Specs](https://www.avanade.com/en/blogs/techs-and-specs/software-development/intelligent-code-creation), focussing on Intelligent Code Creation tools, like Kite and Tabnine.

> Intelligent code creation (ICC) uses machine learning models and embedded intelligence to provide developer support for writing secure best in class code. This can involve a developer co-pilot or an ‘AI pair programming’ approach that flags poor development practices or proposes alternative ways to solve a problem.

> **What is it?**
> This approach provides additional support for existing developers, providing answers to write complex algorithms, trained on other “best of breed” codebases. It also enables new developers to become productive on domain specific code, or closed enterprise owned codebases. Long story short, this is not an update to automatic code generation, but it is about providing support in what and how to develop next. AI becomes your assistant, rather than replacing human ingenuity.

For more information about Intelligent Code Creation tools, the blog post was originally available in full on the Avanade Techs and Specs blog.

> **Update (15 February 2026):** Avanade retired all employee-written blogs in 2025, and the original article is no longer available. The excerpts above are the last remaining copy of this content.
