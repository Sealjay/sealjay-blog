I've been open sourcing projects at Avanade for some time. I've recently needed a ton of automation - from code scans for security vulnerabilities and licensing compliance to automatically merging pull requests after a certain amount of time.

I've just started a new role as Head of Open Technologies for Avanade - bringing together Open Innovation, Open Source, and supporting a broader community. I'll share some of the information I've learnt whilst using GitHub Actions to help my work.

### So, what are GitHub Actions?

[GitHub Actions provide automation for your code repositories](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/automate-workflow-github-actions/?WT.mc_id=AI-MVP-5004204). Each action is described in a YAML defined workflow file that let you execute logic based upon events like Pull Requests, Pushes to branches, issue creation etc.

Many projects need specific workflows and requirements, such as a restriction on the approved open-source licences, a desire to create issues based on '#TODO:' notes buried in code comments, or to make life easier.

### How do you set up a GitHub action?

GitHub Actions YAML files are stored within a code repository, in a dot folder called `.github/workflows/`. You can define one or more _workflows_ which developers can use to group together different related jobs and actions.

Each _workflow_ defines a series of _jobs_. A _job_ is made up of multiple _steps_. A _step_ combines multiple _actions_. Finally, all of this runs on a _runner_ somewhere - a machine or a container spun up to run and execute your workflow.

Finally, you define which _event_ triggers which _workflows_. Got that?! This diagram might show better how everything fits together.

There is a box under the runner, showing a multiple steps in a job - the job example is a called a compliance scan. There are multiple steps, each step has an action. The first step is download a code repo, with the actions/checkout@v2 action. The second step is save cache, with the actions/cache@v2 repo. The final step is run licence scan, with any action you choose.](/images/2021/09/GHA-Blog.png)

I'll talk about some of the Actions I used on my last project (working with Brain Control Devices, a robotics platform, and a robot) and some I'm trying out now. I will assume some familiarity with [the GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/), mainly pull requests, pushes, and branching. [If not, I recommend a read](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)!

## Finding a GitHub Action

There are many different GitHub Actions available on the GitHub Marketplace.

### GitHub Actions for Azure - great for ML

Microsoft also maintains a [specific list of GitHub Actions for Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/github/github-actions?WT.mc_id=AI-MVP-5004204#where-can-i-see-all-the-available-actions) - and some of these are particularly useful for integrating MLOps, or [the practices you need to deploy Machine Learning models in production alongside your code](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/concept-model-management-and-deployment?WT.mc_id=AI-MVP-5004204). GitHub Actions are helpful to improve collaboration between developers and data scientists to increase reproducibility and your machine learning development consistency.

### Licence Compliance

I've tried some of the Open Source licence compliance tools, and I'm now looking at some of the commercial options - I don't have an opinion on those yet, but I can show you some of the OSS tools in use.

I'm still using [`ShiftLeftSecurity/scan-action`](https://github.com/ShiftLeftSecurity/scan-action) from http://slscan.io/ and that tool supports many different programming languages.

For Python repositories, I particularly like [`andersy005/gh-action-py-liccheck`](https://github.com/andersy005/gh-action-py-liccheck) which uses a `pyproject.toml` file format.

Here's an example of these actions in use:

<GitHubGistEmbed id="Sealjay/cb59f8aaf25de08a830b59358d560571" />

### Issues and Work Tracking

I like to use two actions for my issues and my work - [one to create issues for Todos in code](https://github.com/ribtoks/tdg-github-action) called `ribtoks/tdg-github-action` and another to [make sure new pull requests are assigned to a GitHub project board related to the project](https://github.com/AdityaGovardhan/ga-pull-requests-projects) called `AdityaGovardhan/ga-pull-requests-projects`.

Here's an example of these actions in use:

<GitHubGistEmbed id="Sealjay/a3b3848342fef7d279bb85d63e033927" />

## Where to learn more?

GitHub Actions make your life so much easier.  [I recommend the Microsoft Learn path](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/automate-workflow-github-actions/?WT.mc_id=AI-MVP-5004204) to get hands-on and try out some examples.
