### Tagline

> VP, AI Consulting Transformation at Kyndryl | Created Kyndryl's FDE capability - scaling to 22,000 engineers | 6x Microsoft AI MVP | Doctoral researcher in Green Software Engineering, UEL

### Bio

I'm VP of AI Consulting Transformation at Kyndryl, where I created the Forward Deployed Engineering capability - engineers embedded with clients to build, ship, and own outcomes, not just advise; now scaling to 22,000. I focus on agentic AI, open source, and governance that ships rather than stalls.

I've been recognised six times as a Microsoft MVP in Artificial Intelligence, and I'm a contributor to ISO/IEC 21031:2024 (Software Carbon Intensity) through my work with the Green Software Foundation, where I formerly served as Steering Committee Vice-Chair. I'm currently pursuing a doctorate in Green Software Engineering at the University of East London (2022-2027) and was an OpenUK New Year's Honours 2025/26 recipient for contributions to open source.

I co-host Securing the Realm, a D&D-inspired podcast on AI governance and AI-driven development (securing.quest). My background spans law, engineering, and open source leadership - I think about regulation, liability, and compliance as design constraints, not afterthoughts. I stay hands-on, building with agentic AI, open source tooling, and green software.

### Headline

> Started with IRC bots at 9, now bridging AI transformation with green software and open source at Kyndryl | VP | 6x AI MVP // open, sustainable, real

### About

I lead AI consulting transformation at Kyndryl as Vice President - building the systems, teams, and governance that make AI adoption stick in large enterprises. I created our Forward Deployed Engineering capability: engineers embedded with clients to build, ship and own outcomes, not just advise - now scaling to 22,000 engineers. My focus is making AI adoption real and repeatable, from agentic systems to responsible governance.

I stay hands-on. I build with open source, contribute to international standards (ISO/IEC 21031:2024 on Software Carbon Intensity), and experiment with emerging approaches in agentic AI and AI governance. I'm pursuing a doctorate in Green Software Engineering at the University of East London, and I was recognised as an OpenUK New Year's Honours 2025/26 recipient for contributions to open source. Six times a Microsoft MVP in Artificial Intelligence.

My journey started young: IRC bots and MUD servers at nine, a browser game at thirteen, a law degree, then back to tech for good. My legal background gives me a different lens on AI governance - I think about regulation, liability, and compliance as design constraints, not afterthoughts. I formerly served as Steering Committee Vice-Chair at the Green Software Foundation and led platform strategy and incubations at Avanade.

AI that only works in a lab is not AI that matters. I co-host Securing the Realm (securing.quest) - a D&D-inspired podcast on AI governance and AI-driven development. // open, sustainable, real.
